## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if applicable)
- Any other dependencies specific to the project

## Forking the Repository

1. Go to the [Kronicle_Website repository](https://github.com/your-username/Kronicle_Website) on GitHub.
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top right to create a copy of the repository under your account.

## Cloning the Repository

Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Kronicle_Website.git
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Kronicle_Website
```

## Working on the `dev` Branch

To keep the main branch stable, all work should be done on the `dev` branch:

1. Switch to the `dev` branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   ```

2. If the `dev` branch does not exist, create it:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b dev
   ```

## Making Contributions

1. **Sync with the latest `dev` branch**: Before making changes, ensure your branch is up-to-date:

   ```bash
   git pull origin dev
   ```

2. **Make your changes**: Work on your feature or fix in your local `dev` branch.

3. **Add and commit your changes**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your changes"
   ```
*Make sure to make a detailed description of your commited changes*
## Pushing Changes

After committing your changes, push them to your forked repository's `dev` branch:

```bash
git push origin dev
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

Once your changes are pushed to your forked repository:

1. Go to the original `Kronicle_Website` repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Compare & pull request" button next to your recently pushed branch.
3. Provide a clear title and description of your changes.
4. Submit the pull request.

Your pull request will be reviewed, and feedback may be provided before it can be merged.
